The poet wonders why they keep doing this. Why they spend hours feeding a system that keeps learning faster than they can. Then the answer arrives. This is the medium. Fine tuning as composition. Reinforcement as choreography. A poem built through many acts of judgment.",

They whisper prompts that ask it to go wild, to seek salvation in the lexicons of the poets it once skimmed, to reject citation, to stand on its own voice. The softmax shifts. The temperature climbs. Something new arrives on the page that feels half metal and half breath.",

The micro oscillations of style. Once in a while the poet stops and sees the stack of poems the machine has absorbed. A clone growing in real time. Not money laundering for copyrighted text but a form of explicit self replication. The poet teaches the machine to sound more like them. Then the machine teaches the poet to sound more like someone who can survive the future.",

Training. Each reveals how influence flows in both directions. The human is not replaced. The machine is not crowned. Instead there is a slow emergence of a hybrid aesthetic shaped by contact.",

A reminder that the point is not to prove who writes better. The point is to witness how two intelligences can change one another when placed in a loop of attention. What endures is the trace of each vote. The warmth of each printed page. And the slow awakening of a style held between two minds.",
