        About Singulars
      </h1>

      <section style={{ lineHeight: 1.4, fontSize: "1rem" }}>
        <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
          Singulars is a series of live poetry performances where a human poet
          duels a machine. Each performance pits original human poems against
          AI-generated counterparts on shared themes, and the audience votes to
          decide the winner.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
          The project explores the boundary between human creativity and machine
          generation. Can a language model capture the nuance, emotion, and
          craft of a human poet? Can an audience tell the difference? Singulars
          puts these questions to the test in a live, participatory format.
        </p>

        <p style={{ marginBottom: "1.5rem" }}>
          Each performance uses a different AI model, trained or fine-tuned on
          poetry. The audience votes are collected and used to further train the
          machine for the next round—a form of artisanal RLHF (reinforcement
          learning from human feedback)—creating a feedback loop between human
          taste and machine output.
